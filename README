WARNING: I've found there are segmentation faults that occur
seldomly. However they do still occasionally occur. They happen
during my reduce stage.

I also realize my run times scale quite poorly. my algorithm is
to travers to the end of the list and either add to the end of the
list or delete the end of it. These algorithms could have been 
expedited by either storing a pointer to the tail to quickly jump 
there or to simply add and delete from the head of the list.
